<h2 style="color:SteelBlue;">Final Project Model:</h2>
<h3 style="color:LightSteelBlue;">This is my initial sketch for a final project. I'll document its progress here over the next few weeks. My idea was inspired by the lack of cooking space in my current appartment: This device is meant to provide extra counter space, while being able to fold up so that it can be stored under a bed when not in use. </h3>
