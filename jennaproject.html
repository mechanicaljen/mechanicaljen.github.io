<h2 style="color:Black;">Final Project Model:</h2>
<h3 style="color:Gray;">This is my initial sketch for a final project. I'll document its progress here over the next few weeks. My idea was inspired by the lack of cooking space in my current appartment: This device is meant to provide extra counter space, while being able to fold up so that it can be stored under a bed when not in use. </h3>

<h4 style="color:Black;">Week 2: Laser Cutting:</h4>
<h5 style="color:Gray;">Week 2: This week, I made a miniature model of a cutting board with a laser cutter. I had a lot of fun using the laser cutter, and I think that this gave me some good ideas for my final project.</h5>
