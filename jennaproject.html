<h1 style="color:SteelBlue;">Hello, and welcome to my project page for Rapid Fabrication for Everyone! This page highlights some of my favorite weekly projects, as well as progress on my final project.</h1>

<h2 style="color:SteelBlue;">Final Project Model:</h2>
<h3 style="color:LightSteelBlue;">This is my initial sketch for a final project. I'll document its progress here over the next few weeks. My idea was inspired by the lack of cooking space in my current appartment: This device is meant to provide extra counter space, while being able to fold up so that it can be stored under a bed when not in use. </h3>

<h2 style="color:SteelBlue;">Week 2: Laser Cutting:</h2>
<h3 style="color:LightSteelBlue;">This week, I made a miniature model of a cutting board with a laser cutter. I had a lot of fun using the laser cutter, and I think that this gave me some good ideas for my final project!</h3>

<h2 style="color:SteelBlue;"> Week 3: Electronics Production: </h2>
<h3 style="color:LightSteelBlue;">This week we made printed circuit boards! I didn't get quite as far as I wanted this week--After class Friday, I still had some shorts that I was not able to eliminate.</h3>

<h2 style="color:SteelBlue;"> Week 4: 3D Printing: </h2>
<h3 style="color:LightSteelBlue;">This week, I printed a spoon holder! Pictured below with and without a spoon:</h3>

<h2 style="color:SteelBlue;"> Week 5: CNC Cutting: </h2>
<h3 style="color:LightSteelBlue;"> This week, I used a router to make a little Utah: </h3>

<h2 style="color:SteelBlue;"> Week 7: Embedded Programming: </h2>
<h3 style="color:LightSteelBlue;"> This week, I programmed my arduino board to blink. The link below shows a video: </h3>
<h2 style="color:SteelBlue;"> Week 8: Interfaces: </h2>
<h3 style="color:LightSteelBlue;"> This week, I set up an interface with Alexa and my arduino board! The link below shows a video: </h3>
<h2 style="color:SteelBlue;"> Week 9: Input Devices: </h2>
<h3 style="color:LightSteelBlue;"> This week, I set up a temperature gage to connect with my arduino board. The link below shows a video: </h3>
<h2 style="color:SteelBlue;"> Week 12: Mechanical Devices: </h2>
<h3 style="color:LightSteelBlue;"> This week, I completed the legs of my table for my final project. I took apart two standing desks and attached their bases together. The handles are located in the middle of the two desks. When squeezed, the base rises to the upright position shown below. I'm happy with how this part of my final project turned out! The table reaches a height which should work well for cooking.  </h3>

<h1 style="color:SteelBlue;"> Final Project: </h1>
<h3 style="color:LightSteelBlue;"> Shown below are a few pictures of my final project! I discussed how the base of the table was created in the entry for Week 12. I created the table tops by ironing wood veneer onto two boards of equal size. Next, I used a laser cutter programmed to use a design I had simplified in adobe acrobat. The table tops attatch to the base with velcro, so they can be interchanged with each other. Overall, I'm really happy with how this project turned out! I've learned a lot in this class, and I enjoyed getting to apply some of what I've learned to this final project.</h3>
